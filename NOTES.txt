- How to daemonize syncilainen?
    - seem to have some problems with subprocess when deamonized
    - can we rely on upstart/launchd to do the daemonization?

- Need to refactor code to properly take into account the config file
    - i.e. accomodate multiple watch directories, each with different configurations..
        - currently:
            "auto_pull_secs": 30,
            "path": "~/WORKING/syncilainen/sandbox",
            "notifier": {
                "enabled": true,
                "disable_after_n_errors": 3
             },
             "action": {
                "class": "vcs",
                "type": "git",
                "remote": "origin"
            }

- Should we try to implement hg or bzr as an alternative to git?
    - At least to 'prove' the abstraction

- Should there be a way to start a watch directory without creating a local and remote repository and configuring them both?
    - probably not
    - should be some documentation/example

- Should we add a push even when the status list is empty?
    - I think this is done?
